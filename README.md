## Imperception UWP v1.0.2 (alpha)

This is my fork of the desktop monogame demo project by Lexyvil:
https://lexyvil.itch.io/imperception

My main goal is/was: adaptation for W10M (Astoria included). 
And second (goal): explore "virtual pad" hiding problem on Astoria.

## My 2 cents (status)
- Project tuned on(to) tweaked Monigame.Framwork (and "firm" v3.7.xx.xx)
- Some project research and minimal "re-dev" (virtual gamepad, etc.)))
- W10M UWP adaptation ready! :)
- VS 2017 (IDE) compatibility for best W10M debug process =)
- Min. W10M build: 10240 (hello, Astoria!)

## A few words (description) frow the author

"What was supposed to be a short game for a MonoGame game jam had turned out to be an idea for a potential future project. This demo made for the game jam was not finished on time,  sadly, due to being too ambitious and I did not estimate my time well for my first jam. But the proof of concept is there at least..."

### Controls
- Left/Right buttons Left/Right move(ments)
- Up: Enter Doors.
- Down (or E on phisical keyboard): Action Key (Hide player / Show again)))

### Goals / Todo-s
- Add more rooms
- Add more gameplay elements (Other than simply roaming and avoiding death)
- Improve AI
- Add story elements
- Add more sound effects for everything
- Fix on-screen button scaling (or button hit coordination) (!)

### Gamedev/Design
- Coder: Lexyvil
- Art: Garuu, Nene
